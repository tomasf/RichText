# RichText

RichText is a macOS-specific companion library for SwiftSCAD that adds TextKit-based text generation. This enables proper Unicode support, richer typography, attribute ranges, multi-line text, constrained layout, bounding boxes, glyph-level manipulation and more.

This package also contains a `Geometry2D` extension for `CGPath` that can be used for other Core Graphics-related purposes.
